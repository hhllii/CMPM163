# CMPM163-Homework3

### A. Creative Text Animation
* SDF Font 
  Use SDF font to render the text. The bitmap font is generated by bitmap font generator link: http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/. Use the bitmap to create the SDF font by using a Signed Distance Bitmap Font Tool link: https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/491938-signed-distance-bitmap-font-tool/. Load the texture to the shader to render the SDF font. Provide 3 fonts: arial, roman and stencil.
* Values of the SDF
  Add gui to control some parameters.
* Animated and interactive
  GUI enable some interactions.

### B. Shadertoy-Style Scene
* rendered using a GLSL fragment shader <br>
  Use the THREE.PlaneGeometry() as the geometry and create shader to render the material of the plane. The plane fills the window so the fragment shader will be responsible for rendering every pixel in browser window.<br>
* Use 3D SDFs to generate the objects in the scene <br>
  Generate the object by sdTorus(), boxSDF(), sphereSDF() and cylinderSDF(). Use the intersectSDF(), unionSDF() and differenceSDF() function to create constructive solid geometry.<br>
* Morph into another<br>
  Use some trigonometric functions to make the objects move around the scene in period. The distance operations will make the object morph.
* Add textures to the SDF objects in the scene<br>
  Pass the texture to shader by Textureloader.<br>
