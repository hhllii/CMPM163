### A. Creative Text Animation

### B. Shadertoy-Style Scene
* rendered using a GLSL fragment shader <br>
  Use the THREE.PlaneGeometry() as the geometry and create shader to render the material of the plane. The plane fills the window so the fragment shader will be responsible for rendering every pixel in browser window.<br>
* Use 3D SDFs to generate the objects in the scene <br>
  Generate the object by sdTorus(), boxSDF(), sphereSDF() and cylinderSDF(). Use the intersectSDF(), unionSDF() and differenceSDF() function to create constructive solid geometry.<br>
* Morph into another<br>
  Use some trigonometric functions to make the objects move around the scene in period. The distance operations will make the object morph.
* Add textures to the SDF objects in the scene<br>
 Â Pass the texture to shader by Textureloader.<br>
